# GraphQL-Server

This is only a learning repository! I just created this to know how to use the GraphQL.

The GraphQL have some concepts, the we need to know: 

* Schema;
* Query;
* Mutations.

## Schema

The Schema is like a contract, it's describe the funtionallity avaible to client. 

To create a schema we need a block called type, that add to schema utilities like:

* Create relationships between other types.
* Define wich operation of Query and Mutations have to be executed by client.
* Show wich resouces are avaible to the client.

### Type Query

> The type Query define the data queries contracts. It's very similar to GET of API's REST.

### Type Mutation

> This Type define the contract of data manipulation. Compared to REST it is like those methods POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE.
